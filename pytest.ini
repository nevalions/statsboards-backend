# Performance optimizations
# Removed Alembic migrations - biggest speedup (60-90s saved)
# -x: stop on first failure (good for development)
# -v: verbose output
# --tb=short: shortened traceback format
# --disable-warnings: faster output
# --no-cov: disable coverage collection for speed
# --asyncio-mode=auto: allow running async tests without decorators in some cases
# -m "not integration": skip integration tests by default (run with -m integration to enable)
# Limit parallel workers to avoid connection pool exhaustion
# Each worker creates a Database instance with connection pool
# With -n auto on systems with many cores, can exceed PostgreSQL max_connections=200
# Skip slow tests by default (websocket, download service with retries)
