# General Principles

- Follow existing patterns rather than creating new ones
- Keep functions focused and single-responsibility
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Use type hints everywhere for better IDE support
- Write tests before or immediately after implementing features
- Always run lint and test commands before considering a task complete
- Never hardcode credentials or secrets - use environment variables
- Use Pydantic Settings for configuration in `src/core/config.py`
