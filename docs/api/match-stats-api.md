# Match Stats API

### WebSocket Endpoint: Real-time Match Statistics

#### Connection

```typescript
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:9000/api/matches/ws/matches/{match_id}/stats');
```

#### Message Flow

1. **Client connects** to WebSocket endpoint
2. **Server sends** `full_stats_update` immediately on connection
3. **Client receives** `stats_update` messages when stats change
4. **Client can send** `stats_update` messages to update stats (with conflict resolution)

#### Server-Sent Messages

##### 1. Full Stats Update

Sent immediately after client connects.

    }

}
```

##### 2. Stats Update

Broadcast when any client updates stats (or server-side changes occur).

```json
{
  "type": "stats_update",
  "match_id": 123,
  "stats": {
    "match_id": 123,
    "team_a": { /* full stats structure */ },
    "team_b": { /* full stats structure */ }
  },
  "server_timestamp": "2026-01-02T17:31:00.123456"
}
```

##### 3. Stats Sync (Conflict Resolution)

Sent when client's update is rejected due to conflict (server has newer data).

```json
{
  "type": "stats_sync",
  "match_id": 123,
  "stats": {
    "match_id": 123,
    "team_a": { /* current server stats */ },
    "team_b": { /* current server stats */ }
  },
  "server_timestamp": "2026-01-02T17:32:00.123456"
}
```

#### Client-Sent Messages

##### Update Stats

Client can send stat updates with timestamp for conflict resolution.

```json
{
  "type": "stats_update",
  "match_id": 123,
  "stats": {
    "match_id": 123,
    "team_a": {
      "id": 1,
      "team_stats": {
        "offence_yards": 255
      }
    },
    "team_b": { /* unchanged */ }
  },
  "timestamp": "2026-01-02T17:33:00.123456"
}
```

**Conflict Resolution:**
- Server compares client `timestamp` with last write timestamp
- If client timestamp is newer → update accepted and broadcast to all other clients
- If server timestamp is newer → update rejected, client receives `stats_sync` with current data

#### Stats Schema Details

##### Team Stats

```typescript
interface TeamStats {
  id: number;
  offence_yards: number;        // Total yards gained by offense
  pass_att: number;             // Total pass attempts
  run_att: number;              // Total run attempts
  avg_yards_per_att: number;    // Average yards per play (offence_yards / (pass_att + run_att))
  pass_yards: number;           // Total passing yards
  run_yards: number;            // Total rushing yards
  lost_yards: number;           // Total yards lost (sacks, fumbles, etc.)
  flag_yards: number;           // Total penalty yards (negative value)
  third_down_attempts: number;   // Third down attempts
  third_down_conversions: number; // Third down conversions
  fourth_down_attempts: number;   // Fourth down attempts
  fourth_down_conversions: number; // Fourth down conversions
  first_down_gained: number;     // First downs gained
  turnovers: number;             // Total turnovers (interceptions + lost fumbles)
}
```

##### Offense Stats

Keyed by `player_match_id` (player in match ID).

    run_yards: number;      // Rushing yards
    run_avr: number;        // Average yards per rush
    run_td: number;         // Rushing touchdowns
    fumble: number;          // Fumbles
  };
}
```

##### QB Stats

Keyed by `player_match_id`.

```typescript
interface QBStats {
  [playerMatchId: number]: {
    id: number;              // player_match_id
    passes: number;          // Total passes attempted
    passes_completed: number; // Completed passes
    pass_yards: number;      // Passing yards

    interception: number;     // Interceptions thrown
    qb_rating: number;       // NFL-style QB rating

**QB Rating Formula:**
```
QB Rating = (8.4 * pass_yards + 330 * pass_td + 100 * passes_completed - 200 * interception) / passes
```
